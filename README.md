Basic EOC Emulator

EOCBasics is an emulator project that is aimed to emulate the 751 EOC Revision of RS (RuneScape). This project promotes open-source and developer-in-mind ideals. As the project progresses, it will feature full support of packets, frames, and full of content.

If you want to contribute to this project, please keep the "customs" out. This project's aim is to keep it as RS was as 751.
